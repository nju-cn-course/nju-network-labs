# Git & GitHub

You can use Git to manage your projects with a clear editing history and we recommend using it.  You should at least know some basic usage of Git. The tutorial of Git is listed below.

* [廖雪峰的 Git 教程](https://www.liaoxuefeng.com/wiki/896043488029600)

At least, the commands you should know are:

* git clone
* git add
* git commit
* git push
* git pull

Besides, we will use GitHub Classroom for assignment submission. You can learn how to submit your assignment with GitHub classroom at the following websites:

* [GitHub Classroom: How students complete assignments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObaFRGp\_Eko)

Currently, Github no longer supports passwords to access repositories. You may need to use ssh keys or tokens to connect to GitHub, please read the following two pages for more details:

* [Creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/cn/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
* [Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://docs.github.com/cn/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

You can use either of the two methods above to access your repository. Note: if you choose to use the token-based method, remember to enable the writing authority when generating the token.

&#x20;We expect that you will cost 2 days on this.
