# Python

Switchyard and Mininet are developed in Python, so you need to program in Python. Although there are some methods to bypass Python, we recommend you to try out it, especially considering that Python is an easy-to-learn language. If you are not familiar with it, here are some materials for you to get started.

* [廖雪峰的 Python 3 教程](https://www.liaoxuefeng.com/wiki/1016959663602400)
* [Python 教程](https://docs.python.org/zh-cn/3/tutorial/index.html)
* [Learn Python - Free Interactive Python Tutorial](https://www.learnpython.org/)
* [Python 编程：从入门到实践](https://box.nju.edu.cn/library/a62f5af1-85e5-4333-a00a-0e9942bcf3d7/ComputerNetwork2021Spring/)

Once you are familiar with Python, we recommend [RealPython](https://realpython.com) to learn the advanced usage of Python modules.

Our VM has Python preinstalled (both version 2 and 3) so you can skip installing. If you are using a custom environment, you can skip Python 2 since it is unnecessary. Topics you need to know about Python are listed here:

* Python Interpreter
* Data Types (Important)
* Data Structures (Important)
* Flow Control (Important)
* Functions (Important)
* Modules
* Input and Output
* Errors and Exceptions
* Standard Library
* Virtual Environments and Packages (Important)

While some topics are marked as important, there is no need to scrutinize them, just program as you learn. We expect that you will cost about 3 days on this if you haven't worked with Python before.

{% hint style="info" %}
Python 3 is the main language you will use in the experiment. Our Mininet in the VM defaultly supports Python 2 module but you can also use Python 3 for Mininet by installing `mininet` module with `pip3`. For details, please refer to [Mininet section](../workflow/mininet.md#custom-topologies). In our VM, you need to type `python3` to start Python 3 and `python` to start Python 2.
