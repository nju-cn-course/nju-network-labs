## Policies

We encourage discussions with others to clarify questions about homework problems and programming assignment problem statements. However

{% hint style="danger" %}
1. Solutions must be your own. If we find any form of plagiarism, either from your classmates or Internet, you will receive **0 point** from this lab.
2. **DO NOT** make your remote repository public.
{% endhint %}

## Grading

Your submissions are graded by:

* 60% code
* 40% report

### Code

You are required to present your code to a TA in the class. We will grade your code based on your understanding of the lab and your code quality. The criteria are as follows:

* _**90-100**_ Completed all tasks with clear and thorough understanding.&#x20;
* _**80-90**_ Passed all tests but misunderstood some concepts.
* _**60-80**_ Failed in some tests.
* _**below 60**_ Left some tasks undone.

Additionally, we welcome innovation. If your realization is creative, we may grant bonus points.

### Report

You are required to submit a report for each lab to Github Classroom. The criteria are as follows:

* _**90-100**_ The report is neat, clear and complete, with comprehensive and in-depth analysis describing how you fulfill the tasks.
* _**80-90**_ The report is complete, with required experimental procedures and screenshots.
* _**60-80**_ Some parts of the report are missing.
* _**below 60**_ The report is incomplete, or the format is confusing.

Additionally, we appreciate concise report. If your report is too lengthy and tedious, we may deduct some points.

## Feedback

You can use **pull requests** of each lab to ask questions or give us feedback.

For example, if you want to feedback about lab-1, go to GitHub lab-1 repository page:
