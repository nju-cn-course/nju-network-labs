# Task 1: Preparation

You can start with copying the content from Lab-4 to Lab-5.

1. Clone the [Lab-5](https://classroom.github.com/a/VlkKYsUN) assignment template codes. You should focus on `myrouter.py` to implement our router.
2. Copy `start_mininet.py` from Lab-4 to this repository.
3. Copy `myrouter.py` from Lab-4 to this repository.

Finally, your project will look like:

```text
.
├── README.md
├── forwarding_table.txt
├── myrouter.py
├── start_mininet.py
└── testcases
    ├── routertests3.srpy
    └── routertests3_template.py
```
