# Task 1: Preparation

Clone the Lab-3 assignment template codes. You should focus on `myrouter.py` to implement our router.

Though we will provide the test files, they are incomprehensible. So you should still write test scenarios that test all aspects of your code. You can find our test files in `testcases/`.

The project structure is as follows:

```
.
├── README.md
├── myrouter.py
├── start_mininet.py
└── testcases
    ├── myrouter1_testsenario.srpy
    └── test_submit.py
```
