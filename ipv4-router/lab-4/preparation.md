# Task 1: Preparation

You have implemented a part of router in `myrouter.py` in Lab-3. We will continue on it.

1. Clone the Lab-4 assignment template codes. You should focus on `myrouter.py` to implement our router.
2. Copy `start_mininet.py` from Lab-3 to this repository.
3. Copy `myrouter.py` from Lab-3 to this repository.

Finally, your project will look like

```

├── README.md
├── myrouter.py
├── start_mininet.py
└── testcases
    ├── myrouter2_testscenario.srpy
    └── test_submit.py
